<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">The International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (“World Bank“) and its officers, agents, employees, and content providers maintain this website (the “Platform”) as part of their efforts to provide broad public access to data and information for development. We encourage Users to use the information and data it contains, as well as communication tools designed to facilitate this use. Unless explicitly stated otherwise, the Platform, its data, communication tools, and any new tools made available that alter or improve the use of the Platform or the data shall be subject to this Agreement (“Terms and Conditions” or “PUMA Terms and Conditions”).</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">By using the Platform, Users acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agree to be bound by the PUMA Terms and Conditions, as well as the general terms and conditions of the World Bank, which can be found here:&nbsp;</span><a class="rvts34" href="http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/0,,contentMDK:20146401~pagePK:50016803~piPK:50016805~theSitePK:13,00.html">web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/0,,contentMDK:20146401~pagePK:50016803~piPK:50016805~theSitePK:13,00.html</a><span class="rvts6">.</span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">The World Bank general terms and conditions are incorporated herein by reference. Where these PUMA Terms and Conditions conflict with the World Bank general terms and conditions, these PUMA Terms and Conditions shall control. </span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">These Terms and Conditions may be amended by the World Bank from time to time at its sole discretion. As new data continues to be added to the Platform, and terms and conditions for use of that data may change, Users should check back here for the latest Terms and Conditions before using the Platform or accessing or using any data. </span></p>

<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6"><br/></span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts6">The Platform for Urban Management and Analysis (“PUMA”) is an online geospatial software tool created by the World Bank as part of its East Asia and Pacific Urban Flagship study. PUMA allows Users with no prior experience in geographic information systems to access, analyze and share urban spatial data in an interactive and customizable way. For example, maps and graphs on urban expansion may allow researchers and policy makers to understand broad trends in urbanization, while more detailed data on land use in individual cities can help inform land use planning decisions. </span></p>
