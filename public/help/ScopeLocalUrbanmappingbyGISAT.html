<span class="rvts12">Local scope</span></p>
<h4 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18">This scope provides the most detailed view of all available scopes into geographically based information. Spatial detail of this analysis is high and can be represented by e.g. unique blocks of built-up. This scope is suitable for observation of detailed trends in local land cover structure and development, such as construction of particular building blocks in a particular neighborhood. Not only spatial resolution, but also thematic detail of the analysis is very high at this scope. Urban built-up is differentiated into multiple types - classes. Commercial, industrial or transport units, construction sites and urban green areas, as well as three different densities of urban fabric are defined in the frame of urban land cover at this level. </span></span></h4>
<h4 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18">Results of urban mapping performed by </span></span><span class="rvts0"><a class="rvts21" href="http://gisat.cz/content/en" target="_blank">GISAT</a></span><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18"> are used as a representational data source for this scope.</span></span></h4>

<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts18">This dataset represents land use/land cover mapping on a local level, with relatively high spatial detail. Both status and change mapping have been performed. </span></p>
<p class="rvps6"><span class="rvts18">The dataset has been prepared by the </span><a class="rvts19" href="http://www.gisat.cz/content/en">GISAT</a><span class="rvts18"> company, based on a very high-resolution satellite imagery data. The dataset is intended for detailed analysis of urban land cover and changes, especially their internal structure (e.g. urban sprawl level and structure). The following picture provides an example of results of the mapping.</span></p>
<h4 class="rvps7"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18"> </span></span><img width="475" height="413" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem172.png"/><img width="475" height="414" alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem171.png"/></h4>
<h4 class="rvps8"><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18">Details on this urban mapping, including mapping nomenclature, minimal mapping unit and mapping accuracy, can be found in chapter 2.1 of the PUMA Interim report. In the frame of this mapping, five metropolitan areas in the </span></span><span class="rvts0"><a class="rvts19" href="http://www.worldbank.org/en/region/eap">East Asia and Pacific Region</a></span><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18">, defined by World Bank requirements, have been mapped. The following picture shows cities that were objects of this mapping and which are also listed in the menu for</span></span><span class="rvts0"><a class="rvts19" href="Selectingterritory.html##territoryMenu"> place selection</a></span><span class="rvts0"><span class="rvts18">.</span></span></h4>
<h4 class="rvps7"><img alt="" style="padding : 1px;" src="lib/NewItem174.png"/></h4>
<p class="rvps9"><span class="rvts18">Besides this dataset, ancillary road and population data have been used for this local scope analysis, to demonstrate potential of land cover / land use and change analysis at this detailed level in connection with data from other sources. Population data for Surabaya administrative units have been provided by the World Bank. For the other four cities, populations for the years 2000 and 2010 were calculated from the </span><a class="rvts19" href="http://www.asiapop.org/">AsiaPop dataset</a><span class="rvts18">. </span></p>
<p class="rvps9"><span class="rvts18">For demonstration of analysis based on line datasets in the PUMA platform, ancillary layers of </span><span class="rvts16">road network</span><span class="rvts18"> have been incorporated into the analysis. The source of this road data is mainly Open Street Map, which provided both vector geometry and information about road width category. Original width categories have been used as well as their reclassification into more general road types. For the Surabaya Core City area, road data have been provided directly by the World Bank. </span></p>
